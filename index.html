  	Reading a good book can transport you to another world. You may find yourself picturing yourself living the story or thinking about it even when you're not reading it. Here are a few more reasons that you should read on a regular basis:
  	<ul>
  		<li>It is stimulating</li>
  		<li>It makes you think creatively</li>
  		<li>It can be very fun!</li>
  	</ul>
